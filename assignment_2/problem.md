problem
- recursion programming hard to design and debug
- openscad has no break; which not convenient for loop and recursion
- hard to balance the probability especially when using recursion which made probability stack on each recursion
- random seed not working too many re occurant of pattern
- when using random seed from rands function the first generate city and later is not the same regardless of using the same seed
